## Worksheets collection behavior in .NET Framework
The default behavior for the Worksheet collection base in .NET Framework has changed from 1 to 0. 
This is the same behavior as in .NET Core.
For backward compatibility the property<code>IsWorksheets1Based</code> can be set to true, to have the same behavior as in previous version of EPPlus.
This property can also be set in the app.config:

```xml
  <appSettings>
   <!-- Set worksheets collection to start from one.Default is 0,  
        for backward compatibility reasons this can be altered 1. -->  
   <add key = "EPPlus:ExcelPackage.Compatibility.IsWorksheets1Based" value="true" />
   </appSettings>
```
